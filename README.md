  Greetings,
</div>
<br>

I'm Dinis Martinho, an 18-year-old university student with a passion for **generative AI**, **game development**, **computer graphics**, and **web development**. I have experience working with **GANs** and **DDPMs** and have explored applications such as **image generation**, **style transfer**, and **image inpainting**. In addition to that, I've been actively involved in various computer vision tasks, including **segmentation**, **classification**, and **object detection**. I've also had the opportunity to work with text models in the past, which expanded my skill set. 

I've participated in several competitions and projects, constantly applying my skills to develop innovative solutions. One of my notable experiences was in the [ARCADE](https://arcade.grand-challenge.org/) (Automatic Region-based Coronary Artery Disease diagnostics using X-ray angiography images) competition, where I was part of the fifth-placed team **[( TeamZERO )](https://arcade.grand-challenge.org/teams/t/3329/)**. Our team's collaborative effort and innovative approach contributed to our success in the competition, and it was a valuable experience that deepened my understanding of medical imaging and machine learning in a real-world context.
