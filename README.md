  Hello,
</div>
<br>
I'm Dinis Martinho, an 18 year-old machine-learning enthusiast. My practical experience includes working with Generative Adversarial Networks and Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models for tasks like image generation, style transfer, and image inpainting. Engaging in computer vision tasks such as segmentation, classification, and object detection has allowed me to develop foundational skills.
<br>
My most notable experience within this area involves contributing to the fifth-placed team, TeamZERO, during the MICCAI23 ARCADE competition. This collaborative effort not only provided me with valuable insights into the application of machine learning in real-world scenarios, especially in medical imaging contexts but also led to my active participation as one of the paper's authors, outlining the processes employed during the competition.
